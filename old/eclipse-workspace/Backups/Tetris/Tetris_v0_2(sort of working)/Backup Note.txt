I copied collision detection part of my Box project and modified it to work in Tetris.
For reasons that my mortal brain is unable to comprehend, it is working PERFECTLY.

Right and left collision detections are as one would expect them to be.

Bottom collision detection however, has one cell offset, meaning that it won't give 'true' if tetromino is "on" the 
ground, but after it is "one cell below" the ground. 

This is because I don't want tetrominos to get fixed instantly when they touch the ground or other tertominos.
In the original tetris too - as far as I can remember - a tetromino can move even if it's collided from below,
for one frame. Anyway, I am writting this note to myself, and I believe that I can remember what my intentions was.

Cheers, myself!
